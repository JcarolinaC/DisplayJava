# About this repository
The logical test of a 7-segment display was carried out with the following objectives:
Objective: Create pseudocode for a program that prints numbers in style
7 segment display.
Input: The input contains multiple lines. Each line contains 2 numbers
separated by comma. The first number represents the number of times
will print the string (between 1 and 5). The second number is the number to display on
the screen (maximum 5 digits). To terminate the program, you must type 0,0. This
will terminate the application.
Output: Print the specified numbers using the "-" character for the
horizontal characters, and “|” for verticals, for horizontal segments
use 3 characters “-”.
